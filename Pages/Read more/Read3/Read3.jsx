        <p>How to Help Someone With Anxiety.</p>
      </div>
      <div className="paragraphRead11">
        Anxiety is a normal part of life. A healthy dose of worry is even
        considered protective since it alerts us to danger. However, if you
        notice that a friend, family member, or loved one is overly worried
        about things like daily tasks, their family’s safety, or situations
        others see as non-threatening, this healthy level of anxiety may have
        turned excessive. Learning how to help someone with anxiety can help you
        feel more empowered, and help your loved one manage their symptoms more
        effectively.

          If someone you care about has anxiety, learning more about the
          condition can help you better understand what you can do to help.
          Recognizing anxiety, being willing to listen, and offering your
          support are all essential. However, it's also important to know what
          isn't helpful, such as telling them to just snap out of it or trying
          to force them to get help. Don't try to be their therapist—your goal
          is to offer support, kindness, and empathy.

        Learn About Anxiety One of the most important things you can do to help
        someone with anxiety is to learn more about the condition. Knowing more
        about anxiety can help you empathize and understand more about the ways
        you can help.

          Anxiety disorders affect 40 million American adults age 18 or older,
          or 19.1% of the population each year, making it the most common mental
          illness in the United States
        </div>
      </div>
      <div className="paragraphRead11">
        While anxiety is a treatable disease, many people are never treated for
        it. Globally, only around 27.6% of people with an anxiety disorder
        receive treatment
        <br />
        <br />
        Since anxiety is such a complex disorder, it can be difficult to define
        and diagnose with a single set of general criteria. Because of this,
        mental health professionals have broken down the disorder into several
        categories, including generalized anxiety disorder, panic disorder, and
        social anxiety disorder .
        <br />
        <br />
        Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD)
        <br />
        Generalized anxiety disorder or GAD is characterized by excessive worry,
        thoughts, emotions, and actions that occur most of the time for at least
        six months. People with GAD typically worry about everyday activities
        such as work, money, family, and health.
        <br />
        <br />
        Panic Disorder
        <br />
        <br />
        According to the National Institutes of Mental Health, panic disorder
        occurs in people who have recurrent unexpected panic attacks, which are
        sudden periods of intense fear, anxiety, or discomfort.3 Some people
        experience a need to flee until the episode is over, which usually peaks
        in a matter of minutes.
        <br />
        <br />
        Social Anxiety Disorder
        <br />
        <br />
        Also called social phobia, the Anxiety and Depression Association of
        America (ADAA) says this type of anxiety is characterized by an intense
        fear of being judged, negatively evaluated, or rejected in a social or
        performance situation Anxiety and Depression Association of America.
        Social anxiety disorder. Because of this, they often avoid these types
        of situations, and if they can’t, they experience significant anxiety
        and stress.
        <br />
        <br />
        Understand the Signs of Anxiety
        <br />
        <br />
        Anxiety can manifest in many different ways and levels of severity.
        However, the symptoms or signs are often the same.
        <br />
        <br />
        While not an exhaustive list, the following are some of the most common
        physical, mental, and behavioral :

        If your friend or loved one is frequently asking some form of "what if
        something terrible happens" and then looking to you for reassurance,
        Saltz says by reassuring them, you are actually perpetuating their
        anxiety.
        <br />
        Instead, she recommends pointing out that because you care about them,
        you notice they are reassurance-seeking, and it's actually making them
        more anxious in the long run.
        <div className="greenflag">
          <div className="darkgreen"></div>
          <div className="greenflagparagraph">
            Then, Saltz says you can suggest methods of decreasing their anxiety
            such as meditation practice, exercise, deep breathing, or talking to
            a therapist
          </div>
        </div>
        <br />
        <br />
        Listen and Help Facilitate a Plan
        <br />
        “If you know someone who is struggling with anxiety, reach out to them
        and provide support by just listening to what they have to say,” says
        Catherine Richardson, LPC, a Talkspace therapist. If you’re not sure how
        to start the conversation, Richardson says to ask them how you can help.
        <br />
        <br />
        Together, you can come up with a plan to facilitate this process, such
        as meeting in person, talking on the phone, or connecting online.
        Richardson also recommends asking them if there is something they enjoy
        doing like going to the park, going to a particular restaurant, or
        watching a favorite movie, that you could do together.
        <br />
        But most importantly, she says, encourage them to seek help if you feel
        like they are really struggling and could benefit from therapy.
        <br />
        <br />
        Recognize What Can Help In addition to receiving professional medical
        help, individuals struggling with anxiety are encouraged to seek out
        ways to help manage their symptoms at home. There are a variety of
        approaches and activities people can try as part of an overall treatment
        plan, including:
        <br />
        <br />
        <li>Regular exercise or any type of physical activity6 </li>
        <li>Mindfulness meditation and deep breathing7</li>
        <li>Progressive muscle relaxation management</li>
        <li>Sleep8</li>

          interventions. Sleep Med Rev. 2022;61:101583.
          doi:10.1016/j.smrv.2021.101583
        </li>
        <li>
          Limiting alcohol and caffeine (both can trigger anxiety and panic
          attacks)
        </li>
        <li>
          Challenging negative thoughts and focusing on what you can control
        </li>
        <li>
          Limiting worry time, but not fighting it (giving a time limit of 10–20
          minutes to worry through all of the issues that bother you, then
          turning it off)
        </li>
        <br />
        <br />
        Know What Is Not Helpful
        <br />
        According to Saltz, it’s important to understand that continuing to be
        the one to say "don’t worry about that because…" is not actually
        helping, even if your friend or loved one thinks it is. “You can't make
        someone stop seeking reassurance, but you can tell them it's actually
        making the situation worse,” she says.
        <br />
        Another mistake to avoid, Richardson says, is taking on the role of a
        clinical professional.
        <br />
        <br />
        Instead, Richardson recommends being supportive and transparent and let
        your friend or loved one know you're there for them. "You can also share
        what might have worked for you, but then give them space and
        unconditional positive regard as they navigate their own journey," she
        says.
        <div className="greenflag">
          <div className="darkgreen"></div>
          <div className="greenflagparagraph">
            It’s also important to avoid judging and blaming a loved one when
            they are feeling anxious. Even when you’re the most frustrated,
            stop, take a breath, and step back. They need to see that you love
            them unconditionally, even when anxiety is high.
          </div>
        </div>
        <br />
        <br />
        Set Limitations
        <br />
        <br />
        "You may suggest help, but at the end of the day, you cannot force
        help," Saltz says.
        <br />
        <br />
        When this happens, Saltz says you can help them find a therapist or
        offer to accompany them to the session, but you can't actually force
        them to go or force them to participate in a meaningful way.
        <br />
        <br />
        Knowing your limitations also includes taking care of yourself. This is
        especially true if you are in a relationship with someone who is dealing
        with anxiety.
        <div className="greenflag">
          <div className="darkgreen"></div>
          <div className="greenflagparagraph">
            By talking to a mental health expert, you can better understand your
            role and how to best manage emotions while supporting a loved one.
          </div>
        </div>
        <br />
        <br />
        Know When It’s Time to Ask for Help
        <br />
        Even though the symptoms of anxiety can feel overwhelming and permanent,
        anxiety is highly treatable. If someone you love is experiencing
        pervasive anxiety, or you have concerns that anxiety is interfering with
        daily life, encourage them to seek help from their primary care
        physician or mental health professional. Of all the ways to help someone
        with anxiety, this may be the most important one.
